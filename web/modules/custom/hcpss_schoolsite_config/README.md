# HCPSS School Site Configuration

This is a simple Drupal module to house configuration settings that are used
throughout HCPSS school sites.  The module adds custom settings on the site
information form (https://example.com/admin/config/system/site-information).

The following are a list of custom settings and their relevant notes:

**School Code** - While set to an initial value that it guesses from the
database name, the value can be overridden via the form.  This setting is used
for Twitter profiles and site search collections.

**Facebook URL** - The value should include the full https URL of the school's
Facebook page.

**Blog URL** - The value should include the full URL of the school's blog.
